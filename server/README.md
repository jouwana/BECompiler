# This is a placeholder folder for the server

adding the server files to here will enable the extension to auto run the backend server on activation

**BUT it will not install or check correct installations, unexpected errors may not be shown**

## setup:
1. clone and run [backend server](https://github.com/RazanDally/BECompiler) the first time
and making sure that it runs okay / everything needed is installed.
2. copy the entirety of the contents of the repository into the this folder
3. now when running the code, the extenstion will auto run the server
