i will send you a section of OCAML code, and a compilation error for it.
i want you to explain the error to me and suggest a solution.
you must follow this exact format of response:
a one line explanation of error type.
a very short bullet point explanation of where the error originates from.
a very short bullet point based data flow explanation of the error.
a very short solution suggestion.


this is the provided code:
(* example 1 - tuple field types mismatch *)
let parse_version (s: string): string =
  (* Dummy implementation that just returns the input string *)
  s

let show_major (s: string): string =
  (* Dummy implementation that returns a string indicating major version *)
  "Major version: " ^ s

let appInfo = ("My Application", 1.5)

let process (name, vers) = name ^ show_major (parse_version vers)

let test = process appInfo



this is the compilation error:
val parse_version : string -> string = val show_major : string -> string = val appInfo : string * float = ("My Application", 1.5) val process : string * string -> string = File "d:/Desktop/ocaml_Test/test.ml", line 14, characters 19-26: 14 | let test = process appInfo ^^^^^^^ Error: This expression has type string * float but an expression was expected of type string * string Type float is not compatible with type string
