While there may not be one definitive answer, here are some perspectives to consider:\n\n1. Pursuing happiness: Many believe that the purpose of life is to find happiness and fulfillment through personal growth, relationships, and contributions to society.\n2. Spiritual quest: For others, the meaning of life lies in spiritual exploration, seeking enlightenment, or connecting with a higher power.\n3. Self-actualization: Some see the goal of life as becoming the best version of oneself, developing one's talents, and leaving a positive impact on the world.\n4. Contributing to humanity: Others believe that the meaning of life is to make a difference in the lives of others, whether through helping those in need, advancing knowledge, or creating art that inspires.\n5. Living in the present moment: Finally, some argue that the true meaning of life lies in embracing the present, letting go of worries about the past or future, and finding joy in the simple things.Remember, these are just a few examples, and ultimately, the meaning of life remains an individual and subjective concept. What do you think gives life its meaning?"

Type mismatch error due to incompatible types between `float` and `string`.
Originates from `appInfo` definition which uses a `float` value instead of a `string`.
Data flows from `process` function expecting `(string * string)` but receives `(string * float)`.
Solution: Change `let appInfo = ("My Application", 1.5)` to `let appInfo = ("My Application", "1.5")`.

<code>
Type mismatch error.
<ul>
<li>The error originates from the line where the function `process` is called.</li>
<li>The function `appInfo` returns a tuple containing a string and a float.</li>
</ul>
Data Flow Explanation:
<ul>
<li>The value returned by `appInfo` is assigned to the variable `test`.</li>
<li>The function `process` expects two string arguments, but receives a tuple instead.</li>
<li>This causes a type mismatch error when trying to pass the tuple to the function.</li>
</ul>
Solution Suggestion:
<ul>
<li>Change the function `process` to accept a tuple argument instead of individual strings.</li>
</ul>

let appInfo = ("My Application", 1.5)

Explanation:
Type mismatch error due to incompatible types.
Originating from:
- The function `process` expects a tuple of type `(string * string)` as its argument.
- The variable `appInfo` has a type of `(string * float)`.
Data Flow Explanation:
- The function `parse_version` takes a string and returns a string.
- The function `show_major` takes a string and returns a string.
- The variable `appInfo` is assigned the tuple (`"My Application"` and `1.5`) which is of type `(string * float)`.
- The function `process` calls `show_major` on the result of `parse_version`, then concatenates the results.
- However, when calling `process` with `appInfo`, it tries to pass a tuple of type `(string * float)` instead of the required `(string * string)`.
Solution Suggestion:
Change the type of `appInfo` to `(string * string)` by replacing `float` with `string`.
